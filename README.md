# Woomies
**Find your Work Roomie!**

## Overview
Over 4 million college students take on summer internships every year. However, finding short-term housing for summer internships in cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Seattle, and Boston can be an overwhelming experience for students. With limited time and unfamiliarity with new environments, many interns are left scrambling for information, often relying on scattered, unverified sources such as social media posts, forums, or word-of-mouth.

**Woomies** is a platform designed to streamline this process by offering a centralized, reliable solution for finding short-term rentals and compatible roommates.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Housing Search and Ranking**: Filter housing listings by proximity to your internship locations, desired nearby facilities, and public transit availability
- **Streamlined Roommate Matching**: Match with potential roommates based on your budget, location, internship dates, and lifestyle preferences (like sleeping habits, cleanliness, etc.)
- **Neighborhood Insights**: Gain instant access to information about neighborhood safety and various amenities and facilities available near your location

With **Woomies**, we hope to take the stress out of finding short-term housing so you can focus on what really matters - making the most of your internship, building new connections, and enjoying your summer experience.


###### The platform is currently in early development. As more features are implemented, any updates to the repository will be made **here**. Thank you for your patience!
